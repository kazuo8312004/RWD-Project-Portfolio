                <p>Hey there! I’m Embrie Dela Rosa of ACT-2, showcasing my portfolio as a dancer, who’s been moving to the beat since I was 8 years old.
                    It all started with my cousin, who was not only a choreographer but also the person who introduced me to the world of dance.
                    I began with hip-hop and modern dance, but over time, I’ve expanded my knowledge because of experiences to include styles like Waack, Femme, House, Breakdancing, and Pop & Lock.
                    One of the highlights of my dance journey was winning my first competition with my twin sister Novie, cousins, and fellow dancers.
                    It was a huge win and one I’ll never forget! Not long after, my twin sister became my dance partner.
                    We started as the Avira Twins, where we first discovered our love for dance.
                    As we evolved, we became 2in Fusion, blending different styles and creating something unique together.
                    Now, as the Dela Rosa Twins, we’ve built a strong identity that reflects our experiences and passion for dance.
                    Together, we took a giant leap into the spotlight by joining ABS-CBN Dance Kids Season 1 as Avira Twins before.
                    Our dance journey has always been about growth, connection, and transformation.
                    That was definitely the biggest risk I’ve taken as a dancer, but it led to some incredible experiences.
                    Throughout that journey, we met some amazing people, including AC Bonifacio, Nate Porcalla (now with BGYO), Sheena Belarmino, and more.
                    We also got the chance to appear on Showtime’s Twin It to Win It segment show, which was such a fun experience! 
                    For me, dance has always been about passion, expression, and growth. I’m constantly learning, evolving, and pushing my limits.
